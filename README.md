# QuickNotes

QuickNotes is a simplistic yet feature-enriched note-taking application built with Vue 3, showcasing the robust capabilities of the Vue ecosystem including Vue Router, Pinia, composables, and directives. This project also integrates Google Firebase for real-time data management. While the design is minimalist, utilizing the Bulma CSS framework, the core focus is on demonstrating a structured, scalable, and clean codebase.
